            Love Japanese sushi? Us too! Though it might seem like a delivery- or takeout-only meal, <br>
            we’re here to tell you that it’s totally attainable at home. Though it does take a long time<br>
            to become a professional sushi chef (seriously, they train for up to 10 years!), you <br>
            (yes, you!) can make delicious rolls with just a few key ingredients and techniques. The best part? <br>
            We’ve included some classic recipes here, but you really can fill them with whatever you want—tempura,<br>
            veggies, pickles… doesn’t have to be limited to just fish. Check out our best sushi recipes for ideas<br>
            you’ll only get better with practice, so get to rolling!It’s ALL about the rice. The word sushi actually<br>
            means “sour rice” in Japanese, so if you’re going to attempt sushi at home, you’ve got to get it right. <br>
            Don’t be intimidated, we’ve got a sushi rice guide to get you started. Basically, you’ll be adding rice wine<br>
            vinegar (the “sour”) to your rice in a particular way. If it’s not perfect the first time, no worries—your<br> 
            rolls will still taste delicious.</p>
