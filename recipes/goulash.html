    <h1>Goulash</h1>
    <img src="../images/goulash.jpg" width="600" height="600">

    <p>If you think Hungary and think hearty food, then Goulash is probably exactly what comes to mind.<br> 
        Unsurprising given it is Hungary’s greatest food export!Is it a stew? Is it a soup? It sort of <br>
        lies between the two in terms of the amount of broth vs the stuff in it. Though one noticeable <br>
        thing about traditional Goulash is that the broth is thinner than what you think of with stews, <br>
        and it’s not thickened with flour or cream. Also, it’s not typically served over mash like stews, <br>
        it’s served in bowls like soup.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paprika</li>
        <li>Caraway seeds</li>
        <li>Beef stock/broth</li>
        <li>Beef chuck</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Bay leaf</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Garlic & Onion</li>
        <li>Parsley & Carrot</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Cut beef into nice size chunks then sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook onion first for 6 minutes until the edges are light golden.</li>
            <li>Cook beef – Next, add the beef all in one go and stir until the surfaces changes from red to brown.<br>
                You won’t be browning on the beef because there’s too much in the pot and that’s just how it’s supposed<br> 
                to be. All the flavours meld and come together in the next steps!</li>
            <li>Add garlic, capsicum and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes to coat the vegetables in all the flavour in the pot.<br> 
                The tomato will mostly breakdown – it will break down completing during the slow cooking phase and thicken the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spices – Add paprika, caraway and bay leaf. Stir for 30 seconds to coat everything in the tasty flavours.</li>
            <li>Simmer – Add beef stock, stir, bring to simmer.</li>
            <li>Slow cook – Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 1 1/2 hours. At this stage the beef should be <br>
                pretty tender but not quite “fall-apart”, there’s still another 30 minutes to go. Stir in carrot and potatoes<br> 
                then cook for another 30 minutes. By this time, the potatoes (if you cut them the exact size I specify!!) <br>
                should be soft and the beef should be “fall-apart”.</li>
            <li>Serve – Sprinkle with parsley if you’re feeling fancy then ladle into bowls!</em></li>
    </ol>
