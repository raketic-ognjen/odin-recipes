        <h1>Chicken  Basque</h1>
        <img src="../images/chicken-basque.jpg" width="600" height="600">
        <p>The delicious combination of chicken and rice, olives and peppers is typical of all the regions<br> 
            around the western Mediterranean but, to my mind, this Spanish version, with the addition of<br>
            spicy chorizo sausage and a hint of paprika, beats the lot.</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 x 3½ lb (1.75 kg) chicken, jointed into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>brown basmati rice measured to the 8 fl oz (225 ml) level in a glass measuring jug</li>
            <li>10 fl oz (275 ml) chicken stock (or stock made from Marigold vegetable bouillon powder)</li>
            <li>6 fl oz (170 ml) dry white wine</li>
            <li>½ large orange, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>1 level teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 oz (50 g) black olives (pitted if you prefer)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly milled black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large red peppers</li>
            <li>1 veri large or 2 medium onions</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>5oz(150gr) chorizo sausage, shinned and cut into ½ inch(1cm) slices</li>
            <li>2oz(50 gr) sun driedtomatoes in oil</li>
            <li>2 large cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 level tablespoon sun-dried tomato paste</li>
            <li>½ level teaspoon hot paprika</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Start by seasoning the chicken joints well with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Next, slice the red peppers in half and remove the seeds and pith, then slice each half into<br>
                six strips. Likewise, peel the onion and slice into strips of approximately the same size. <br>
                The dried tomatoes should be drained, wiped dry with kitchen paper and then cut into ½ <br>
                inch (1 cm) pieces.</li>
            <li>Now heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in the casserole and, when it is fairly hot, add the chicken pieces<br>
                two or three at a time and brown them to a nutty golden colour on both sides. As they brown remove<br>
                them to a plate lined with kitchen paper, using a draining spoon. Next add a little more oil to the<br>
                casserole, with the heat slightly higher than medium. As soon as the oil is hot, add the onion and <br>
                peppers and allow them to brown a little at the edges, moving them around from time to time, for <br>
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>After that, add the chorizo, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and toss these around for a minute or<br>
                two until the garlic is pale golden and the chorizo has taken on some colour. Next, stir in the rice<br> 
                and, when the grains have a good coating of oil, add the sun-dried tomato paste, paprika and chopped thyme.<br> 
                Pour in the stock and wine, and add some seasoning. As soon as everything has reached simmering point,<br>
                turn the heat down to a gentle simmer. Add a little more seasoning, then place the chicken gently on<br>
                top of everything (it's important to keep the rice down in the liquid).</li>
            <li>Finally, place the wedges of orange in among the chicken and scatter with the olives.</li>
            <li>Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook over the gentlest possible heat for about 50 minutes-1 hour or<br>
                until the rice is cooked but still retains a little bite. You can also watch how to make Perfect Rice<br> 
                in our Cookery School Video for Long-grain Rice on this page.</li>
            <li>Alternatively cook in a pre-heated oven at gas mark 4, 350°F (180°C), for 1 hour.</em></li>
