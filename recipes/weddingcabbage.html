        <h1>Wedding Cabbage</h1>
        <img src="../images/wedding-cabbage.jpg" width="600" height="600">
        <p>This is a dish whose history can be traced back to the Middle ages. The name is derived <br>
            from the fact that the dish was most commonly prepared for the weddings or similar big <br>
            feasts that require amounts of food that can feed large number of people. It gets it <br>
            best flavour if cooked long, in big amount in the clay pot in an open fire.</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1/2 head of sour cabbage, outer leaves pealed, heart removed and cut in 4cm chunks</li>
                <li>100g beef shoulder meat/ 100g pork shoulder meat (fattier parts are better), <br>
                    diced in 4cm chunks</li>
                <li>100g smoked ribs and beacon, bone and meat separated, meat diced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lard</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped medium size</li>
                <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dry parsley</li>
                <li>1 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 pinch of ground pepper</li>
                <li>pinch red sweet paprika</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>50ml sunflower oil</strong></li>
            </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Cover the bottom and the sides of the 18cm wide pot with lard and cover the bottom <br>
                with a whole cabbage leaf.</li>
            <li>In another bowl combine chopped onion, carrot and sunflower oil and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Take a cabbage leaf and wrap each piece of meat in a roll. Layer in the pot, pressing<br>
                 each role against the other tightly so that it wouldnâ€™t open while cooking. Reserve <br>
                 a few leaves.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and carrots to the pot, cover with remaining oil and add the spices, <br>
                bay leaf and pour in 500ml cold water.</li>
            <li>Cover with remaining few cabbage leaves and place inverted plate over the vegetables <br>
                to prevent it from moving when the water boils. Bring to a boil on strong fire, then <br>
                reduce and cook for 40min.</li>
            <li>Turn the fire off and leave for another 30 minutes to be cooked down.</em></li>
