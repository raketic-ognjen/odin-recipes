        <p>Here’s a cozy bowl that’s so hearty and satisfying, you’ll never want to put your spoon down.<br> 
        Try this hearty and easy bean soup! Make room in your heart for this recipe, because it dazzles. <br>
        Kidney beans and navy beans float in a savory, smoky broth of fire roasted tomatoes that has just<br>
        the right glossy texture. It uses canned beans, but it tastes like it’s been simmering all day. <br>
        Each silky, smoky spoonful is a bit of heaven. (Plus, it saves well too!)</p>
